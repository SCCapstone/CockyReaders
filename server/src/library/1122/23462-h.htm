yourselves at my gate ever again.”</p>

      <p>So the goat and the ram made themselves a bag, and went off. And they
went on and on, when suddenly they saw a wolf's head lying in the middle
of the field.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0023-1.jpg" width="600" height="366" style="margin-top: 2em;"
              alt=""
              title="And they picked up the head"/>
      </div>
      <p>And they picked up the head, put it in their bag, and went on again. And
they went on and on, when suddenly they saw a fire burning, and they
said: “Let's go and spend the night there, lest the wolves should eat
us.”</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0024-1.jpg" width="600" height="330" style="margin-top: 2em;"
              alt=""
              title="But when they got there"/>
      </div>
      <p>But when they got there, lo and behold! it was the wolves
themselves who were cooking their porridge, and so they said: “Good
evening, young fellows, and good appetite to you!” And the wolves
answered: “Good evening, Mr. Goat and Mr. Ram! We're just boiling our
porridge, come and have some, and then we'll eat you both up.” At this
the goat took fright, while as for the ram, his legs had been shaking
with fear for some time. Then the goat began to think, and he thought
and thought and at last he said: “Come now, Mr. Ram, let's have a look
at that wolf's head you've got in your sack!” And the ram took out the
wolf's head, when the goat said: “No, not that one. Let's have the other
bigger one!” And again the ram gave him the same head, but he said: “No,
not that one either! let's have the largest of all!”</p>
      <p>And the wolves looked, and thought the ram had a whole sackful of
wolves' heads, and each one of them said to himself: “Well, these are
nice guests to have! I'd better hop off!” And first one said aloud to
the others: “I like your company all right, brothers, but somehow, the
porridge doesn't seem to be boiling very well. I'll just run and fetch
some sticks to throw on the fire.” And as he went off, he thought to
himself: “You and your company be bothered!”—and never came back.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

      </div>
      <p>Then the second wolf kept thinking how he could get away, and he said:
“It seems very funny, our brother went to fetch the wood, but he hasn't
brought the wood, and hasn't come back himself. I'll just go and help
him!”</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

      </div>
      <p>So off he went too, and never came back. And the third wolf was
left sitting there, and at last he said: “I must really go and hurry
them up. What are they dawdling all this time for!” And as soon as he
was gone, he set off running and never so much as looked back.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 13em;">And at that the ram and the goat were delighted. They ate up all the
porridge and then ran away themselves.</p>
      <p style="clear: both;">Meanwhile the wolves had all three met, and they said: “Look here, why
were we three frightened of the goat and the ram? They're no stronger

them left. Then the wolves set off in pursuit, and at last they saw
them, where they had climbed up a tree, the goat on an upper and the ram
on a lower branch. So the eldest wolf lay down under the tree, and
began to show his teeth, looking up at them, and waiting for them to
climb down. And the ram, who was trembling all over from fright,
suddenly fell down right on top of the wolf, and at the same minute the
goat shouted out from up above: “There, that's the one! get me the
largest of all!” And the wolf was terrified, because he thought the ram
had jumped down after him, and you should just have seen him run! And
the other two followed after.</p>

      </div>
      <p>There was once a wolf, and he got very hungry, and so he went to have a
look to see what he could find for dinner. After a bit he saw a ram
feeding in a meadow, so he went up to him and said: “Mr. Ram, Mr. Ram,
I'm going to eat you!” But the ram answered: “Who are you, I should like
to know, that you mean to eat me?”</p>

      <p>“I'm a wolf, and I'm looking for a
good dinner,” said the wolf. “What sort of a wolf do you fancy you are?”
answered the ram, “you're not, you're a dog!” “No, I'm not a dog,” said
he, “I'm a wolf.” “Well then,” answered the ram, “if you're a wolf,
stand at the bottom of the hill and open your jaws wide. Then I'll run
down the hill and jump straight into your mouth.” “All right,” said the
wolf.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>So he stood at the bottom of the hill and opened his mouth wide, while
the ram climbed to the top of the hill. Then he ran down the hill very
fast, and hit the wolf with his horns as hard as he could.</p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">

      <p style="margin-top: 12em;">The wolf rolled over, knocked senseless with the blow, while the ram ran
off home. And there lay the wolf, till at last he came to himself again,
with all his bones aching.</p>

      </div>
      <p>“Well, what a fool I must have been!” thought he. “Who ever saw a ram
jump into one's mouth of his own free will?”</p>
      <p>Then he went on further, just as hungry as ever, and after a bit he saw
a horse walking in a meadow nibbling the grass.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0039-1.jpg" width="650" height="389" style="margin-top: 2em;"

      </div>
      <p>So he went up to him and said: “Mr. Horse, Mr. Horse, I'm going to eat
you!” But the horse answered: “Who are you, I should like to know, that
you mean to eat me?” “I'm a wolf!” “You think again,” answered the
horse, “You're only a dog!” “No, I'm not a dog,” said he, “I'm a wolf.”
“Oh, if you are sure you're a wolf, it's all right. Only I'm not very
fat yet, so you'd better begin on my tail, and meanwhile I'll be
munching some more grass and get a little fuller.”</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">

              title="if you are sure you're a wolf"/>
      </div>
      <p/>
      <p>So the wolf went up to him from behind, and was just going to get to
work on his tail, when the horse let out at him as hard as he could! And
the wolf rolled over, while the horse ran off.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

a noodle! Who ever heard of anyone starting to eat a horse by the tail?”</p>

      <p>And so he wandered on further, when after a bit he saw a pig coming
towards him, so when he got to him he said: “Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, I'm going
to eat you!” But the pig answered: “Who are you, I should like to know,
that you mean to eat me?” “I'm a wolf.” “You're a queer sort of wolf,”
answered the pig, “you're only a dog!” “No, I'm not a dog,” said he,
“I'm a wolf!” “Oh, that's all right then,” answered the pig, “you just
sit down on my back. I'll give you a ride, and then you can eat me.”</p>

      <p>Once upon a time a certain peasant lost his wife, then he lost his other
relations, and then he was left alone with no one to help him in his
home or his fields. So he went to Bruin and said: “Look here, Bruin,
let's keep house and plant our garden and sow our corn together.” And
Bruin asked: “But how shall we divide it afterwards?” “How shall we
divide it?” said the peasant, “Well, you take all the tops and let me
have all the roots.” “All right,” answered Bruin. So they sowed some
turnips, and they grew beautifully. And Bruin worked hard, and gathered
in all the turnips, and then they began to divide them. And the peasant
said: “The tops are yours, aren't they, Bruin?” “Yes,” he answered. So
the peasant cut off all the turnip tops and gave them to Bruin, and
then sat down to count the roots. And Bruin saw that the peasant had
done him down.</p>

Bruin, let's work together again, shall we?” And Bruin answered:
“Right-ho! only this time mind! you can have the tops, but I'm going to
have the roots!” “Very well,” said the peasant. And they sowed some
wheat, and when the ears grew up and ripened, you never saw such a
sight. Then they began to divide it, and the peasant took all the tops
with the grain, and gave Bruin the straw and the roots. So he didn't get
anything that time either.</p>

the cock: “Well, brother Peeter, I think we should get more to eat if
we went and lived in the forest than here at our master's, don't you?”

fly down a little closer and let's get to know each other a little

the cold. When lo and behold! there was old King Frost coming towards
her, and he said: “Hullo, little girl, are you warm?” And she answered:
“Yes, King Frost.” Then he blew a cold breath on to her and again asked:
“Are you warm, little girl?” And she answered: “Yes, King Frost!” Then
he began to make it still colder; he made the branches crack, and
covered them with hoar-frost, and let loose such cold, that you could
hear the air creaking.</p>

and well, in her fine clothes and with her presents. “Well,” thought her
step-mother, “if King Frost has given all those things to the old man's
daughter, he'll give my pretty girl ever so much more.” And she said to
her husband: “Take my daughter to the same place as quick as you can,

angry and blew a cold breath on to the girl, and then asked her: “Are
you warm, little girl?” And she answered: “Fancy asking! You can see I'm
frozen! Be quick and give me the presents, and then get away to your
home.” Then King Frost began to make the girl still colder. And he kept
making it colder and colder till he had frozen her through and through.</p>

and cut off one of his hind paws with an axe. And he brought the paw
home, and said to his wife: “Boil some soup from the flesh, and knit
some warm gloves out of the wool.” So she took off the skin, threw the
flesh into the pot to boil, and sat down to spin the wool.</p>
      <p>And when Bruin woke up, he found his paw gone. There was no help for
it, so he cut a bit of wood off a tree, hewed it, tied it on instead of
his leg, and set out for the village. As he went along he sang:</p>

sister said: “Bruin, Bruin, I'll bake some pies, and you take them and

sit down on a stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!” And the
youngest daughter in the sack heard him and said: “Don't sit down on a
stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!” And the bear thought that this

said to him from out of the sack: “Don't sit down on a stump, don't!
Don't eat a pie, don't!” And the bear thought: “There now, fancy that!
I've come a long way, and yet she can still hear me, and tells me not to
eat a pie!” And so he reached the old man's courtyard, and when the dogs
went for him that time, they all but worried him to death! So he flung
down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: “Did
they welcome you warmly, Bruin, and give you plenty to eat?” “It was
<i>such</i> a warm welcome, and they gave me so much to eat, that I shan't
forget it in a hurry!” he answered.</p>

you take them to my daddy for him to eat.” And so she herself sat down
in the sack, and the bear carried her off. And as he carried her along
he kept saying to himself: “Oh, I <i>should</i> so like to sit down on a
stump, and I <i>should</i> so like to eat one little pie!” And the eldest
daughter said to him from out of the sack: “Don't sit down on a stump,
don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!” And the bear thought: “There now, fancy
that! Look at the long way I've come, and yet she can still see and hear
me!” And so he brought the sack to the old man, and then the dogs came
upon him and all but tore him in bits. And he ran off into the forest
without as much as looking round, and the old man began once more to
live with his three little daughters.</p>

      <h2>THE STRAW OX.</h2>

      </div>
      <p>Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife, and one day she
said to him: “Make me a straw ox and smear him over with pitch.” And he
asked: “What for?” And she answered: “Do what I tell you! Never mind
what it's for—that's my business!” So the old man made a straw ox and
smeared him over with pitch. Then his wife got ready in the early
morning and drove the ox to pasture. She sat down under a tree, and
began spinning flax and saying to herself: “Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh
green grass.”</p>

         <img src="images/illus-0097-1.jpg" width="650" height="340" alt=""
              title="Feed, feed, ox"/>
      </div>
      <p>“Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!” And she went on
spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick
wood, from out of the dark forest, a bear came running, and ran right up
against the ox.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0098-1.jpg" width="650" height="353" alt=""
              title="Who in the world are you"/>
      </div>
      <p>“Who in the world are you?” he asked. And the ox
answered: “I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over
with pitch.” Then the bear said: “Well, if you're smeared over with
pitch, give me some to put on my poor torn side.” And the ox answered:
“Take some!” So the bear seized hold of the ox, when lo and behold! his
paw stuck in the pitch.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0099-1.jpg" width="500" height="361" alt=""
              title="And when he tried to free it"/>
      </div>
      <p>And when he tried to free it with the other
paw, that one stuck too. Then he started gnawing with his teeth, and
they stuck too. He couldn't tear himself away anyhow. And the old woman
woke up and saw the bear stuck fast to the ox. So she ran home and
shouted to her husband: “Come along quick, a bear has stuck fast to our
ox, hurry up and catch him!” And he came along, took the bear, led him
home, and shut him up in the lumber room.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The next day, as soon as the sun rose, the old woman again drove the ox
to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began spinning
flax and saying to herself: “Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of
the field! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field!” And
she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of
the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a wolf came running, and
ran right up against the ox. “Who in the world are you?” he asked. And
the ox answered: “I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and
smeared over with pitch.”</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

              title="So the wolf tried to take some pitch"/>
      </div>
      <p>Then the wolf said: “Well, if that's so, give
me some pitch to put on my poor torn side.” And the ox answered: “By all
means!” So the wolf tried to take some pitch, when lo and behold! his
paw stuck in it. And when he tried to free it, it stuck all the faster.
And the old woman woke up and saw the wolf sticking to the ox. So she
ran to fetch her husband and said: “Come as quick as you can, there's a
wolf stuck to the ox!” And he came and caught the wolf and put him in
the cellar.</p>

      </div>
      <p/>
      <p>The next day, before even the sun had risen, the old woman again drove
the ox to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began
spinning flax and saying to herself: “Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green
grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!” And she went on
spinning and spinning, and fell asleep.</p>

              title="a fox came running"/>
      </div>
      <p>Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a fox
came running, and ran right up against the ox. “What sort of a beast
are you?” he asked. And the ox answered: “I'm the three-year-old ox, all
made of straw and smeared over with pitch.” Then the fox said: “Well
then, give me some pitch to rub on my side.” And the fox was just going
to take some pitch, when he stuck fast and couldn't free himself. And
the old woman woke up and saw the fox sticking to the ox. So she ran to
fetch her husband, and he came and took the fox and put him in the
cellar as well.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0104-1.jpg" width="332" height="450" alt=""
              title="fox sticking to the ox"/>
      </div>
      <p>The next day the old woman again sat down under the tree to spin her
flax while the ox fed, and she began spinning and saying to herself:
“Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh
green grass!” And she went on spinning and spinning and fell asleep.
Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a grey
hare came running and ran right up against the ox. “What sort of beast
are you?” he asked. “I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and
smeared over with pitch.” Then the hare said: “Well then, give me some
pitch to rub on my side.” “Take some!” answered the ox. And the hare
caught hold of him with his teeth, when lo and behold! his teeth stuck
fast. He tore and tore, but couldn't tear them free. And the old woman
woke up, and ran to fetch her husband, and said: “Come as quick as you
can, there's a hare stuck to the ox!” And the old man came, took the
hare and flung him into the cellar. Then the old man began to grind his
knife, and the bear heard him and asked: “What are you grinding your
knife for?” And he answered: “I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off
your back and make myself a fur coat out of it.” But the bear said: “Oh!
don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay
you handsomely.” “Well, mind you do!” answered the old man, and so he
let the bear go free, and he ran off into the forest.</p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0106-1.jpg" width="650" height="473" alt=""
              title="I'm grinding my knife"/>
      </div>
      <p>The next day the old man again began to grind his knife outside the
cellar, and the wolf asked him: “What are you grinding your knife for?”
And he answered: “I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back
and make myself a fur coat out of it.” But the wolf said: “Oh! don't
take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you
handsomely.” “Well, mind you do!” answered the old man, and so he let
the wolf too go free. And again he began to grind his knife outside the
cellar, and the fox asked him: “What are you grinding your knife for?”
And he answered: “I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back,
and make myself out of it a collar for my fur coat.” But the fox said:
“Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll
repay you handsomely.” “Well, mind you do!” answered he.</p>

              title="Well, mind you do"/>
      </div>
      <p>Then the hare was left all alone.</p>
      <p>And again the old man began to grind his knife, and the hare asked him:
“What are you grinding your knife for?” And he answered: “I'm grinding
my knife to take the skin off your back, and make myself some fur gloves
out of it.” But the hare said: “Oh! don't take the skin off my back!
Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.” “Well, mind you
do!” he answered, and let the hare too go free.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Early the next morning the old man heard someone knocking at the gate,
so he asked: “Who's there?” And the answer came: “It's I, the bear, come
to pay you my debt.” And the old man opened the gate, and there was the
bear with a hive of honey he had brought. So the old man took the honey,
when again he heard knock-knock at the gate! “Who's there?” he asked,
and the answer came: “It's I, the wolf, come to pay you my debt.” And
there was the wolf with a whole flock of sheep he had driven up. So the
old man let the sheep into the yard, when again he heard knock-knock at
the gate. “Who's there?” he asked, and the answer came: “It's I, the
fox, come to pay you my debt.”</p>

      </div>
      <p>And there was the fox with a whole
farm-yardful of cocks and hens, and ducks and geese. Suddenly there came
another knock-knock at the gate. “Who's there?” asked the old man, and
the answer came: “It's I, the hare, come to pay you my debt.” And he had
brought with him a whole heap of cabbages. And the old man and his wife
began to live happily together, and always spoke well and kindly of
those beasts.</p>

      <h2>THE FOX AND THE BLACKBIRD.</h2>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0112-1.jpg" width="450" height="265" alt=""

              title="Don't eat my children"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 2em;">A fox was walking through the forest when he fell into a deep hole. And
there he sat and sat, till all at once he began to feel hungry. He
started looking round, but could see nothing. Then he looked up, and
there he saw a blackbird in the tree above weaving its nest, and he
said: “Mr. Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, what are you doing?”</p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 383px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0113-1.jpg" width="383" height="500" style="margin-top: 2em;"

              title="I'm weaving my nest"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 14em;">And the
blackbird answered: “I'm weaving my nest.” “What are you weaving your
nest for?” asked the fox. “To bring up my children in,” answered the
blackbird. “But I'm going to eat your children,” said the fox.</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 375px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0114-1.jpg" width="375" height="500" style="margin-top: 2em;"

              title="Don't eat my children"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 14em;">“Don't
eat my children,” answered the blackbird. “Well then, feed me, I'm
hungry,” said the fox. At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry:
how should he feed the fox? Then he flew off into the village, and
brought back a chicken for the fox.</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 387px;">

              title="And the fox ate the chicken"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 12em;">And the fox ate the chicken, and after a little he said: “Mr. Blackbird,
Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?” And the blackbird answered:
“Yes.” “Well then,” said the fox, “give me a drink!” At that the
blackbird began to fret and to worry: how was he to get the fox a
drink? Then he flew off into the village, and brought back a little
pailful of water for the fox.</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 381px;">

              title="And the fox had a good drink"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 12em;">And the fox had a good drink, and after a little he said: “Mr.
Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?” And the blackbird
answered: “Yes.” “And you got me a drink?” “Yes.” “Well then,” said the
fox, “come and pull me out of the hole!” At that the blackbird began to
fret and to worry: how could he pull the fox out of the hole?</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 378px;">

              title="Then he began to gather sticks"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 14em;">Then he began to gather sticks in the forest and started throwing them into the
hole. And he kept throwing them in and throwing them in, till he filled
the hole. And the fox climbed up on to the sticks and out of the hole.</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0118-1.jpg" width="374" height="500" style="margin-top: 2em;"

              title="And when he had climbed out"/>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 14em;">And when he had climbed out, he lay down right under the tree. And there
he lay and lay, and he said to the blackbird: “Look here, you fed me,
didn't you, Mr. Blackbird?”</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">

      </div>
      <p>And the blackbird answered. “Yes.” “And you
got me a drink?” “Yes.” “And you pulled me out of the hole?” “Yes.”
“Well then,” said the fox, “now make me laugh!” At that the blackbird
began to fret and to worry: how should he make the fox laugh? At last he
said: “Very well, I'll tell you what I'll do.”</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

      </div>
      <p>“I'll fly into the village,
and you run after me.” So they agreed to do that, and the blackbird flew
off into the village and perched on the gate of a rich peasant's house,
while the fox lay down under the gateway. Then the blackbird began to
sing: “Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat! Mistress, Mistress,
bring a lump of fat!” And the fox said: “That's fine, let's have it
again!”</p>
      <p style="clear: both;"> </p>
