         <p>
Long, long ago, in ancient times, there lived a King and Queen,<br/>
And for the blessing of a child their longing sore had been:<br/>
At last, a little daughter fair, to their great joy, was given,<br/>
And to the christening feast they made, they bade the Fairies seven—<br/>
         </p>
      </div>

         <p>
The Fairies seven, who loved the land—that they the child might bless,<br/>
Yet one old Fairy they left out, in pure forgetfulness.<br/>
And at the feast, the dishes fair were of the reddest gold;<br/>
But when the Fairy came, not one for her, so bad and old,<br/>
Angry was she, because her place and dish had been forgot,<br/>
And angry things she muttered long, and kept her anger hot.<br/>
         </p>

         <p>
Until the Fairy godmothers their gifts and wishes gave:<br/>
She waited long to spoil the gifts, and her revenge to have.<br/>
One gave the Princess goodness, and one gave her beauty rare;<br/>
One gave her sweetest singing voice; one, gracious mien and air;<br/>
One, skill in dancing; one, all cleverness; and then the crone<br/>
Came forth, and muttered, angry still, and good gift gave she none;<br/>

         <p>
But said, that in the future years the Princess young should die,<br/>
By pricking of a spindle-point—ah, woeful prophecy!<br/>
But now, a kind young Fairy, who had waited to the last,<br/>
Stepped forth, and said, “No, she shall sleep till a hundred years are past;<br/>
And then she shall be wakened by a King's son—truth I tell—<br/>
And he will take her for his wife, and all will yet be well.”<br/>
            <br/>
In vain in all her father's Court the spinning-wheel's forbid<br/>
In vain in all the country-side the spindles sharp are hid;<br/>
For in a lonely turret high, and up a winding stair,<br/>
There lives an ancient woman who still turns her wheel with care.<br/>
The Princess found her out one day, and tried to learn to spin;<br/>
Alas! the spindle pricked her hand—the charm had entered in!<br/>
            <br/>
And down she falls in death-like sleep: they lay her on her bed,<br/>
And all around her sink to rest—a palace of the dead!<br/>
A hundred years pass—still they sleep, and all around the place<br/>
A wood of thorns has risen up—no path a man can trace.<br/>
At last, a King's son, in the hunt, asked how long it had stood,<br/>
And what old towers were those he saw above the ancient wood.<br/>

         <p>
An aged peasant told of an enchanted palace, where<br/>
A sleeping King and Court lay hid, and sleeping Princess fair.<br/>
Through the thick wood, that gave him way, and past the thorns that drew<br/>
Their sharpest points another way, the King's son presses through.<br/>
He reached the guard, the court, the hall,—and there, where'er he stept,<br/>
He saw the sentinels, and grooms, and courtiers as they slept.<br/>

         <p>
Ladies in act to smile, and pages in attendance wait;<br/>
The horses slept within their stalls, the dogs about the gate.<br/>
The King's son presses on, into an inner chamber fair,<br/>
And sees, laid on a silken bed, a lovely lady there;<br/>
So sweet a face, so fair—was never beauty such as this;<br/>
He stands—he stoops to gaze—he kneels—he wakes her with a kiss.<br/>

         <p>
He leads her forth: the magic sleep of all the Court is o'er,—<br/>
They wake, they move, they talk, they laugh, just as they did of yore<br/>
A hundred years ago. The King and Queen awake, and tell<br/>
How all has happed, rejoicing much that all has ended well.<br/>
They hold the wedding that same day, with mirth and feasting good—<br/>
The wedding of the Prince and Sleeping Beauty in the Wood.<br/>

Once on a time there lived a man hated by all he knew,<br/>
Both that his ways were very bad, and that his beard was blue;<br/>
But as he was so rich and grand, and led a merry life,<br/>
A lady he contrived at last to induce to be his wife.<br/>
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
         <img src="images/illus-0037-1.jpg" width="493" height="650" alt=""

         <p>
For a month after the wedding they lived and had good cheer,<br/>
And then said Bluebeard to his wife, “I'll say good-bye, my dear;<br/>
Indeed, it is but for six weeks that I shall be away,<br/>
I beg that you'll invite your friends, and feast and dance and play;<br/>
And all my property I'll leave confided to your care.<br/>
Here are the keys of all my chests, there's plenty and to spare.”<br/>
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">

“But this small key belongs to one small room on the ground-floor,—<br/>
And this you must not open, or you will repent it sore.”<br/>
And so he went; and all the friends came there from far and wide,<br/>
And in her wealth the lady took much happiness and pride;<br/>
But in a while this kind of joy grew nearly satisfied.<br/>

And oft she saw the closet door, and longed to look inside.<br/>
At last she could no more refrain, and turned the little key,<br/>
And looked within, and fainted straight the horrid sight to see;<br/>
For there upon the floor was blood, and on the walls were wives,<br/>
For Bluebeard first had married them, then cut their throats with knives.<br/>
            <br/>
And this poor wife, distracted, picked the key up from the floor,<br/>
All stained with blood; and with much fear she shut and locked the door.<br/>
She tried in vain to clean the key and wash the stain away<br/>
With sand and soap,—it was no use. Bluebeard came back that day;<br/>
At once he asked her for the key,—he saw the bloody stain.—<br/>

“<i>You have been in the closet once, and you shall go again!</i>”<br/>
“O spare me, spare me! give me time, nor kill me hastily!”<br/>
“You have a quarter of an hour,—then, madam, you must die!”<br/>
“O sister Anne, go up, go up, and look out from the tower;”<br/>
“I'm dead unless my brothers come in a quarter of an hour!”<br/>
            <span style="margin-left: 0.3em;">And Anne looked once, and Anne looked twice, and nothing saw abroad,</span>
            <br/>
            <span style="margin-left: 0.3em;">But shining sun and growing grass, and dust upon the road.</span>

“Come down!” cried Bluebeard, “time is up!” With many a sigh and moan,<br/>
            <span style="margin-left: 0.3em;">She prayed him for a minute more; he shouted still, “Come down!”</span>
            <br/>
“O sister Anne, look out, look out! and do you nothing see?”<br/>
“At last I see our brothers two come riding hastily.”<br/>
“Now spare me, Bluebeard,—spare thy wife!” but as the words were said,<br/>
         </p>

         <p>
And just as Bluebeard's cruel blade was descending on her head,<br/>
In rushed the brothers with their swords,—they cut the murderer down,<br/>
And saved their sister's life, and gained much glory and renown;<br/>
And then they all with gold and plate and jewels rare made free,<br/>
And ever after lived content on Bluebeard's property.<br/>
